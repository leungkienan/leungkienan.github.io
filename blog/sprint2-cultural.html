  <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
  <h2>What is my long term goal or plan?</h2>
  <p>I want to develop my skills in programming to become a full stack dev and my knowledge in accounting/finance to a
    programming role in the commerce industry.</p>

  <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
  <p>I want to meet more people and get to know them better. I enjoy talking to people. </p>

  <h2>My strengths and limitations</h2>
  <p>I work well with following instructions, but struggle a bit when it comes to having too much freedom to come up
    with solutions. My learning growing up was focused on getting the right answer using one method. Through coding I’m
    finding that I am understanding how to overcome this issue and that there are many ways to create things through a
    narrow scope.</p>
  <p>When I’m given a task, I ensure that I am dedicating most of my time towards it as I feel better when I’m keeping
    up with the rest of the team. If I'm stuck with a problem, I feel comfortable to approach my team for help and I'm
    happy to return the favour. </p>

  <h2>How I find help</h2>
  <p>Usually when I am stuck with an issue, I firstly look at ways I could approach the problem. If I can’t find the
    solution, I look it up online, and if that doesn’t work, I’ll go to my team for help and slowly work my way up if
    the previous party can’t quite help me find a solution.</p>

  <h2>What I expect from the facilitation team</h2>
  <p>I think that the facilitation team will help me with any issues I have that is non-technical, but will guide me
    only after I do my best and cannot find a solution for my issues. </p>

  <h2>Scheduling commitments and possible issues</h2>
  <p>I have my university graduation ceremony on the final week of boot camp, so I have some concerns for my team as I
    would have to miss some crucial time.</p>
