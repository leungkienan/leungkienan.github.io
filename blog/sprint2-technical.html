        <h2>Best Practices for Classes and IDs</h2>
        <p>
            Think of a storage warehouse, full of different boxes with varying
            contents inside. With that in mind, we can assign the warehouse with an id
            element
        </p>
        <p>So our warehouse could be setup so that id = warehouse-storage</p>
        <p>
            We know that there are boxes inside the warehouse, so we can tag these
            as a class element
        </p>
        <p>class = box</p>
        <p>If we were to make a div with these elements, it would look like the following:</p>
        <img class="imgSmall" src="../images/classIdExample1.png" />
        <p>
            We can see that there is a warehouse with the id "warehouse-storage" setup, with a box with the class "box"
            setup.
        </p>
        <h2>Why do we use different tags?</h2>
        <p>The warehouse has its own specific ID that we can identify, which has its own unique aspects to it.
            So if we wanted to do something to the warehouse, like expand it or knock down a wall,
            we can locate the specific warehouse we want to modify and make changes to that warehouse.
        </p>
        <p>So with an ID, we can target unique elements and give them special functions or styles. We also use ID's to call certain elements for a specific purpose with JavaScript, but if there are multiple elements with the same ID, our scripts won't know what element to run through and will show an error. </p>

        <p>Classes do not share this restriction, as we can have multiple elements which share the same attributes and characteristics with one another. So our boxes can have the same properties, such as size and shape. </p>
        <p>Unlike IDs, an element can have multiple classes to distinguish one another. So back to our box analogy, we can have a bunch of boxes with televisions in them, so we can give them a "tv" class to categorise them.</p>
        <img class="imgSmall" src="../images/classIdExample2.png" />
        <p>As seen above, we annotate the class with a period, or a '.', whereas the id is annotated with a '#'. </p>
        <p>We can also weave id's with classes, as the element may require some JavaScript properties to make a particular action occur too.</p>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Using these different classifications allows us to get more narrowed and specific styling of particular objects in our webpages</p>
        <p>Going forward, classes are a great way to make your elements stand out and play around with. ID's are great once JavaScript kicks in, as these elements will be using functions and all sorts of commands to make the user experience to the best it can be, but for now, they are a good for separating portions of your webpage into blocks.</p>

           CLASSES 
          <h2>What is a Class?</h2>
          <p>
            Classes are used to identify multiple elements. These are notated
            with a "." as seen below
          </p>
          <img class="imgmain" src="../images/class.png" />
          <h2>When and why do we use classes?</h2>
          <p>
            We want to use classes when you want to style many elements on the
            page. So if you know you will use this element with the same style,
            we will tag the element with the class tag. Classes are also great
            for giving a group of elements specific attributes, so we can have
            headers that have the same features, but some may have different
            colours or different font styles. One would use a class to style
            elements that they want consistent across their code, so things like
            multiple text-boxes on a page may have the same attributes like
            colour, sizing or borders, etc.
          </p>
          <h2>How do we use classes?</h2>
          <p>
            Firstly, in our HTML document, we initialise the class by giving a
            div element the tag.
          </p>
          <img class="imgmain" src="../images/classExample2.png" />
          <p>So the class in the img element is now a "logo"</p>
          <p>
            Then we can look at our css file and intialise the class with a
            period, followed by the logo class name.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I want the reference links to be classed as "linktext", so these
            specific links will share a class with whatever elements I notate in
            the css file.
          </p>
          <img class="imgmain" src="../images/classExample3.png" />
          <p>
            Here, I want the text to be white, bolded and have a font-size of 20
            pixels for elements that are within the class which you can see
            above.
          </p>
        </div>

         ID Box 
        <div class="box">
          <h2>What is an ID?</h2>
          <p>
            An ID is used to identify a single element. These are annotated as a
            '#'
          </p>
          <img class="imgmain" src="../images/id.png" />
          <h2>When and why do we use ID's?</h2>
          <p>
            ID's are specifically used for only one element, so we should use ID
            for elements that have only one instance of itself per page. So we
            won't create multiple objects with an ID tag, as these will clash
            with each other once we dip into JavaScript.
          </p>
          <img class="imgmain" src="../images/maincontentexample.png" />
          <p>
            For instance, if we opened up my page's elements in the browser, I
            have the main content of the page to be classified as an ID
            (highlighted green), as I want this element to remain consistent
            across all of my pages.
          </p>
          <h2>How an ID is used</h2>
          <p>
            We first start by tagging an html element with the id tag as seen
            below.
          </p>
          <img class="imgmain" src="../images/idExample2.png" />
          <p>
            I called this div "main-content", which will be used as the area for
            where my content is shown on the webpage
          </p>
          <img class="imgmain" src="../images/idExample3.png" />
          <p>
            The id here is tagged with a "#", so the id links back to the html.
            This styling will only apply to the div I tagged as main-content
          </p>
        </div>
