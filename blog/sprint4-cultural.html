      <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <p>
        The principles of neuroplasticity are defined as “the selective
        organising of connections between neurons in our brains” or simply put;
        we practice an activity repeatedly and you will get better at it. These
        connections in our brain are like pathways, where our neurons are fired
        off through these pathways and stimulate our brain activity. If we were
        to stop exercising these skills, eventually these paths we opened will
        close and “forget” these skills. It is important for us to keep engaging
        with all sorts of activities to keep our brain stimulated and help it
        flourish and grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        I engage with neuroplasticity through constantly practicing older sprint
        exercises, especially the JavaScript ones. I want to home in on these
        skills as they are the more unfamiliar to me, and they are taking a bit
        longer for me to sink in. By constantly practicing and doing things I
        enjoy, I think I can stimulate areas of my brain that enables my growth
        in coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWIagHUqD8A">This Video</a> by
        Plasticity Centers gave another good take on understanding what
        neuroplasticity is. One thing I learnt from here is that flashcards were
        a prominent way of stimulating memory and strengthening these bonds in
        our brain. Associating words and terms together strengthens a memory and
        allows us to recall them much more fluently.
      </p>
      <h2>Growth</h2>
      <p>
        A growth mindset is a positive, forward thinking where you (yes you)
        believe in your ability to overcome tasks that are seemingly out of your
        capability. It is idea that we should be challenging our brains to shift
        our brain from thinking “It’s too hard, I can’t do it” to “It’s tough,
        but how can I approach it?” Essentially giving up is the last thing on
        your mind when facing tough issues and enables us to be more optimistic
        in our lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was surprised by the studies done and few analogies from Carol Dweck,
        where she spoke of a lesser well-off group of students keeping up and
        even overtaking students from Microsoft as they were always approaching
        their issues with this growth mindset. I have been slowly adjusting to a
        growth mindset and have been seeing more success in my development
        through foundations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will be looking to keep thinking forward and more optimistic about my
        own learning pace. I hope I will be seeing myself take less
        procrastination breaks due to me giving up, and push myself a bit
        further to get these new coding skills nailed in.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ted Talk from Carol Dweck was an interesting perspective on how our
        minds approach problems. Being told that we should try a bit more and
        shift our thoughts to be more progressive can result in resounding
        success.
