      <h2>Differences between HTML and CSS</h2>
      <p>
        So, we’ve had a look at HTML and CSS and their relationship, but what
        makes them different? If I were to describe the two, I’d say that HTML
        is the skeleton of your body, whereas CSS is your skin. HTML essentially
        gives you the structure of the page, but the CSS (skin) will makeup the
        rest of the body to make the page complete.
      </p>

      <br />

      <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
      <p>
        Control flow and loops are no different from going through a routine in
        your daily life. There’s an order of operations that you go through
        everyday, like eating breakfast, then go to work, eat lunch, more work,
        go home, dinner, then go to sleep and this process repeats over again.
        This is a prime example of a loop, but the order that you do your
        routine is the control flow. So the order that the events in your
        routine would be constant (unless something pops up that disrupts the
        flow).
      </p>

      <br />

      <h2>What is DOM?</h2>
      <p>
        DOM, or Document Object Model, is a standard for how documents are
        accessed. The DOM is generally expressed as “a tree of objects” as
        illustrated below.
      </p>

      </a>
      <p>
        The “branches” are formally called nodes, which are made up of
        everything that the document contains. This makes it easier to identify
        where elements are and give a better idea of where to find a specific
        node through JavaScript and run scripts through these nodes.
      </p>

      <h2>Accessing Data from Arrays and Objects</h2>
      <p>
        Objects are a set of data that is liable to change, whereas Arrays are a
        bigger version of objects, where values can also be stored. Objects are
        used to represent a thing, like a cat or a dog, with a set of
        characteristics, aka properties. Objects can store properties like
        strings, numbers, or even other objects and arrays!
      </p>
      <p>
        We use arrays when we want to store a bunch of items into a single
        variable. Think of arrays like a chess board, where we have pieces in
        certain spots that they must start in and move around the array
        according to a set of rules. Like objects, arrays can store anything an
        object can, but stores it in a bigger space.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2>What are Functions?</h2>
      <p>
        Functions are used so that a piece of code can make something perform a
        task. These are built up so that if we do an action, like a mouse click
        on a button, a function is run and provides the user some returning
        action.
      </p>
      <p>
        Functions are setup with the following syntax: function, this being
        followed by a name with parentheses after. So it would look like the
        following:
      </p>
      <p>function name(parameter){code here};</p>
      <p>
        These functions are useful to run algorithms and create complex things
        that HTML and CSS cannot achieve on their own. The dynamism that
        functions bring, make our webpages have greater usability and be more
        interactive.
