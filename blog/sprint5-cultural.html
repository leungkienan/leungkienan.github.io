      <h2>
        What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego
        as a result of the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p>The three things I learnt about myself are the following:</p>
      <p>
        I enjoy learning new things, I may struggle through a tough issue, but I
        will put in the effort to get through and solve it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I found myself to be quite harsh on my own health when I am absorbed
        with learning. When I get stuck into something I enjoy, I find it hard
        to stop to take breaks and refresh myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am more aware of my emotions as I go through my day, so I’ve been
        trying to reward myself more for the accomplishments I do to motivate
        myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have found that I get a (positive) ego boost when I feel a sense of
        accomplishment as I believe I’m learning more as I get through these
        sprints.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The role of values in programming play into how one may go about solving
        an issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Empathy helps others understand each other’s interpretations of
        homogenous issues. Being exposed to others who are stuck in similar
        situations and sharing that experience connects us and lets us work
        together to tackle that problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Self-awareness makes us more aware about your reactions to different
        situations. I think that those who are self-aware have a greater
        understanding and smarter approach towards problems.
      </p>

      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        I was surprised by how much influence these aspects of core learning had
        on my foundations experience. I became more mindful of how I approached
        difficult situations and have a stronger growth mindset doing so.
      </p>

      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        It was difficult for me to lay out my learning plan to a state that I
        deemed acceptable. I found it a bit difficult sticking to a plan with
        self-made boundaries.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I think the core learning allows us to get a better understanding of who
        we are and grab a better insight of what and why we do things. I found
        core learning to be a unique experience, as college and university never
        exposed me to think more critically about my emotions and mindset.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I feel like most aspects of the core learning opened my eyes to a new
        approach of learning. I think that being exposed to different styles of
        learning can be crucial to understanding different people’s perspectives
        and ideas. Although, I feel my hard skills could have been improved on
        with more time, but that lack of knowledge came down to how much time I
        spent working on these skills
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2 class="h2Heading">Preparing for Bootcamp</h2>
      <h2>What is your long-term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        I have spent a bit of time studying Accounting and Finance at
        University, so I want to take this knowledge with me to a web
        development role in a tech-commerce industry. I want to utilise
        programming with a twist of commerce as I’ve enjoyed learning both
        subjects.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I think my resilience to keep focus and fight through difficult tasks
        can be both a strength and limitation for me. I think it will come down
        to how I learn from the people around me and my desire to learn.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I think my biggest non-technical challenge will just be getting
        comfortable talking to new people. I’ve recognised that it takes me a
        bit of time for me to connect and open up with people, but I try my best
        to get things done when necessary
      </p>
      <h2>
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at EDA?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I think I want to improve on my confidence in front of strangers. I
        don’t put myself into those types of situations often, so I think EDA
        will provide me a great opportunity to work on this at bootcamp
      </p>
      <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
      <p>
        I think I expect myself to maintain at a pace on par with my cohort. I
        want to ensure that I’m learning the content thoroughly and I’m spending
        my time effectively. I don’t want to be the one dragging the team behind
        and will put in the effort to maintain that pace.
