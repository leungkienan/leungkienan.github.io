      <h2>Getting Blocked on a Problem</h2>
      <p>
        One instance I got stuck on something simple was going through the
        freecodecamp JavaScript tasks. I remember having a hard time going
        through the Record Collection problem, where I just could not figure out
        why my code would not run. Turns out, I was missing a few semi-colons to
        break up a few lines.
      </p>
      <h2>Solved a Problem in an Elegant Way</h2>
      <p>
        I found that I was able to get the Super FizzBuzz array working much
        quicker than I anticipated. I called back to the task where I used the
        remainder operator “%”, to return fizz, buzz or fizzbuzz to their
        appropriate numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I wrote the function that would take in the number in the array,
        checks if they divide cleanly by 3, 5 then 15 and return either fizz,
        buzz, fizzbuzz or just the number itself if there was a remainder.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used a lot of pseudocode when going through the problems on repl.it.
        I’ve found that planning my code out and trying to understand what the
        steps I need to take to get to the end result is a key part of my
        learning. I also spent more time console logging and going through the
        test documents to see where errors could popup or see where I can start.
