    <!-- Topic: What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?-->
    <div id="main-content">
      <h2 class="h2Heading">Classes vs ID's</h2>

      <div class="boxCascade">
        <div class="box">
          <h2>What is a Class?</h2>
          <p>
            Classes are used to identify multiple elements. These are notated
            with a "." as seen below
          </p>
          <img class="imgmain" src="../images/class.png" />
          <h2>When and why do we use classes?</h2>
          <p>
            We want to use classes when you want to style many elements on the
            page. So if you know you will use this element with the same style,
            we will tag the element with the class tag. Classes are also great
            for giving a group of elements specific attributes, so we can have
            headers that have the same features, but some may have different
            colours or different font styles. One would use a class to style
            elements that they want consistent across their code, so things like
            multiple text-boxes on a page may have the same attributes like
            colour, sizing or borders, etc.
          </p>
          <h2>How do we use classes?</h2>
          <p>
            Firstly, in our HTML document, we initialise the class by giving a
            div element the tag.
          </p>
          <img class="imgmain" src="../images/classExample2.png" />
          <p>So the class in the img element is now a "logo"</p>
          <p>
            Then we can look at our css file and intialise the class with a
            period, followed by the logo class name.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I want the reference links to be classed as "linktext", so these
            specific links will share a class with whatever elements I notate in
            the css file.
          </p>
          <img class="imgmain" src="../images/classExample3.png" />
          <p>
            Here, I want the text to be white, bolded and have a font-size of 20
            pixels for elements that are within the class which you can see
            above.
          </p>

          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Classes give you plenty of freedom to style and manipulate many
            elements in your code, so we can give elements in our html file some
            flair and unique styling.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
          <h2>What is an ID?</h2>
          <p>
            An ID is used to identify a single element. These are annotated as a
            '#'
          </p>
          <img class="imgmain" src="../images/id.png" />
          <h2>When and why do we use ID's?</h2>
          <p>
            ID's are specifically used for only one element, so we should use ID
            for elements that have only one instance of itself per page. So we
            won't create multiple objects with an ID tag, as these will clash
            with each other once we dip into JavaScript.
          </p>
          <img class="imgmain" src="../images/maincontentexample.png" />
          <p>
            For instance, if we opened up my page's elements in the browser, I
            have the main content of the page to be classified as an ID
            (highlighted green), as I want this element to remain consistent
            across all of my pages.
          </p>
