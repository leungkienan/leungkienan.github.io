        <ul> My Personal Values
            <li>Happiness</li>
            <li>Personal Fulfillment</li>
            <li>Friendship</li>
            <li>Trust</li>

          </ul>
        <h2>Describing personal values</h2>
        <p>
            Looking into the core values that I resonate with the most are health, personal fulfillment and friendship with many other values intertwined with these listed. I find my health to be an area I maintain the most, whether it is mentally or physically, I strive to keep myself in a state of happiness and to keep myself looking forward. I also take into consideration other people’s health, so I try to keep in touch with friends to make sure they’re doing well. 
            </p>
        <h2>Ethical Dilemma</h2>
        <p>
            One time that called my values into action was when one of my mates tried to drive home after a long night of drinking. I quickly noticed that they had too much to drink and were in no condition to go home, so I would calmly explain to them that not only their health is at risk, but the lives of other people. I wanted to make sure that no one was being endangered from a situation that could be easily avoided and I’m glad that I convinced them to not get in their car.  
           
        </p>
        <h2>Cultural Influence</h2>
        <p>
            My parents share a Chinese and New Zealand background, so my identity and values are influenced from those cultures. A lot of the things I enjoy stem from my ethnicity, but the values I’ve listed all come from the ideas that my parents and people around me have entrenched within me. 
            </p>
        
        <h2>Strengths and Limitations with my learning</h2>    
        <p>
        Looking at my strengths in regards to learning, I tend to learn things quicker from trying them out or from visual aid. I do well at tasks that provide a template or have clear instructions for how a task is to be completed, rather than having it explained verbally. I’d say I’m a much stronger visual learner than an auditory learner. I also get along with people well, so with team exercises, I feel comfortable working around strangers to learn more about their ideas and their perspectives. 
        
        </p>    
           <h2>What strengths will help my learning journey </h2> <p>
                I think that my strengths above will provide me great opportunities to excel at learning at EDA. I think my confidence with teamwork will help me gel well with others in my cohort and make things more enjoyable to get through. I think if I were to hit a roadblock in my learning, I feel like I would be able to ask another peer for help and get through the issue together. 
                </p>
        
            <h2>Example of teamwork not going the best way </h2>    <p>
                    Back at university, I did many team-oriented projects, but one that stood out the most was my auditing group presentation. A lot of the questions we were tasked involved a lot of specific accounting law to figure out the correct answer. We were all new to auditing, so we spent a lot of time together understanding different pieces of law and applying it to the cases we had to do. A lot of arguing over what should be the best course of action, but we always came to a conclusion that we were satisfied with. We would break down each others perspectives to understand how we went through the questions individually and then piece together a cohesive answer. Our group was successful in presenting and our tutor had issues with our results and was happy about our project. I think this experience was the most cohesive and memorable one for me as it showed me that a group can have disputes, but you can be capable of coming up with the best results if others are open to understanding one another.
