    <h2>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs ids?</h2>
    <p>A Class is used to identify more than one element. These are annotated with a '.' in the css document.</p>
    <p>An ID is used to identify a single element. These are annotated as a '#' in your css document.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We want to use classes when you want to style many elements on the page. So if you know you will use this element 
        with the same style, we will tag the element with the class tag. For example, one would use a class to style different elements names like
        comments, toolbars, or even icons.  
    </p>
    <p>An easy way to think about classes is that these are a way to classify a group of items. For example, we 
        would call an apples and bananas fruit, so the class of these two things to be 'fruit'.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>On the other hand, ID's are specifically used for only one element, so we should use ID for elements that
        will have unique characteristics. An example of an ID being used would be for headers, footers or similar elements
        on the webpage.
    </p>
    <p>We can think of ID's as a way to uniquely attribute something. So you would have your own unique phone number and
        credit card number.
