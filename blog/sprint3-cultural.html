  <h2 class = "h2Heading">Emotional Intelligence</h2>
  <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
  <p>Emotional intelligence, or EQ, is a person's ability to assess emotions. These abilities can include the following</p>
  <li>Identifying Emotions</li>
  <li>Evaluating how others feel</li>
  <li>Controlling one's own emotions</li>
  <li>Perceiving how others feel</li>
  <li>Using emotions to facilitate social communication</li>
  <li>Relating to others</li>

<br>
<h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
<p>Firstly, IQ looks at a person's ability to take in information and logic to come up with a reasonable answer or solution. These abilities are assessed through IQ:
</p>
<li>Visual and Spatial Processing</li>
<li>Knowledge of the World</li>
<li>Fluid Reasoning</li>
<li>Working Memory and Short Term Memory</li>
<li>Quantitative Reasoning</li>
<p>The key difference is that there are more objective right or wrong answers with IQ, whereas EQ assesses one's emotions, and it’s impossible to say whether someone's feelings are objectively correct or not. </p>
<br>
<h2>So why are these Important?</h2>
<p>Being able to identify EQ will help one's journey for success. Understanding people and their emotions can lead to better decision making, as you would be able to identify where one’s view comes from and build upon that knowledge to come up with a solution that shares everyone's ideas. </p>
<p>It also builds trust with one another. People that are understanding of EQ usually have better relationships with those around them. Credentials and accolades aren’t the only key attribute to success. One can have a great IQ, but lack empathy of those around them and struggle to make stronger relationships. </p>
